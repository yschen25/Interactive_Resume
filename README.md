## Introduction

The main idea is to break away from traditional resume websites that merely display work experience, education, and so on. Since I have already created two similar websites before, I started to find them a bit boring.

Therefore, I decided to design an interactive resume website. The background is my desk, with photos I took, a keyboard, books, coffee, and so on. The phone on the desk can be clicked to choose conversations, and the computer in the middle can be accessed after entering a password.

This website also incorporates puzzle elements, where some items can only be seen after solving puzzles. It also includes some Easter eggs that only engineers would know, hoping that users can get to know my personality and traits through this unique approach.

You can **explore and interact with my [interactive resume website](https://www.yschen25.com/interactiveResume/)
 on your own**. For the best experience, I recommend using a screen resolution of 1920 x 1080.

Alternatively, if you prefer, you can watch a [**video walkthrough of the website on YouTube**](https://youtu.be/iKtZwhi1SKE).

if you're interested in a **detailed description with demonstrations**, please continue reading the following.

## Demonstration

First, you might notice that the phone on the website shakes. Clicking on the phone will reveal the screen, and you can choose from several question buttons. 

For instance, if you click on "Tell Me About Yourself," the response will appear on the screen, and the same goes for the other question buttons.

Now, let's click on the computer. It will prompt you to enter a password, with the tip "The request succeeded." 

As an engineer, we all know it will return HTTP code 200 when the request succeeded. So enter it and submit! Congratulations, you can now use my computer.

You can explore the pages I'm browsing, such as one of my favorite games, Life is Strange, or visit the portfolio page to see my other works. Alternatively, click on the taskbar to see the software I'm currently using.

Do you also notice the lock next to the computer? The hint says, "Ask Capoo for the password." Capoo is a blue bugcat designed by a Taiwanese - Laya. Try to ask Capoo about the password. 

After successfully unlocking the locker, you'll find a shining rose, click on the rose to see what happens next.

<br/>

If you'd like to leave me a message, you can click on the stack of papers on the desk and start typing. As you type, you'll notice a pencil writing along with you. This is one of the features I like most. 

You can also read feedback from others. Welcome to leave any feedback to me!

There are still plenty of other objects waiting for you to interact with. if you are interested in visiting this website, I will put the information and link below.

But I think the website still needs improvements, such as storing the password in the database instead of on the front end. Add a chatbot to allow users to ask questions by entering the text on the phone, then the chatbot will automatically answer the questions. Finally, add a game to the computer, such as Tetris.
